Yes, it is possible to connect Firefly (a blockchain solution built on top of Hyperledger Fabric) to your web application. Firefly provides a set of APIs that you can use to interact with the blockchain network and integrate it with your web application.

Here's a high-level overview of the steps involved in connecting Firefly to your web application:

Set up a Hyperledger Fabric network: Follow the instructions provided by Firefly to set up a Hyperledger Fabric network. This involves installing and configuring the Fabric components such as peers, orderers, and channels.

Deploy and interact with smart contracts: Use Firefly's tools and documentation to develop and deploy your smart contracts on the Fabric network. This typically involves writing chaincode using languages such as Go or Node.js.

Configure Firefly API server: Firefly provides an API server that exposes endpoints to interact with the Fabric network. Configure and start the API server according to the provided instructions. This server will serve as the interface between your web application and the blockchain network.

Integrate API calls in your web application: In your web application's backend code, make HTTP requests or use SDKs provided by Firefly to interact with the Firefly API server. You can perform actions such as submitting transactions, querying data from the blockchain, or subscribing to events.

Handle responses and update UI: Process the responses received from the API server in your web application's backend code. Update your user interface (UI) accordingly based on the blockchain data retrieved or the status of the transactions.

It's important to note that the exact integration steps and code implementation will depend on the specific requirements of your web application and the APIs provided by Firefly. It's recommended to refer to the official Firefly documentation, tutorials, and examples to understand the detailed integration process and to make use of any SDKs or libraries provided by Firefly for easier integration.

If you invoke a function on the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain in the test network and specify only `peer0` of `ORG1` in the CLI command without specifying `peer0` of `ORG2`, the transaction will only be sent to and executed by `peer0` of `ORG1`.

In a typical Hyperledger Fabric network, multiple peers are part of different organizations and form a distributed network. Each organization may have one or more peers. When invoking a transaction, it is usually recommended to send the transaction to all relevant peers to ensure consistency and fault tolerance across the network.

However, if you specifically target only `peer0` of `ORG1` in the invocation command, the transaction will only be processed by that peer. It won't be sent or executed on `peer0` of `ORG2` or any other peers that might exist in the network.

This can have implications depending on the network design and the logic of the chaincode being invoked. If the chaincode logic relies on multiple peers for consensus or to update the ledger state, omitting certain peers from the invocation may result in inconsistencies or incomplete updates across the network.

It's important to carefully consider the network topology, endorsement policies, and the expected behavior of the chaincode when deciding which peers to include in the invocation command.

To see all the transaction history of the blockchain in Hyperledger Fabric, you can use the `peer channel fetch` command to retrieve the block data and then analyze the transactions within each block. Here's a step-by-step process to accomplish this:

1. Identify the channel for which you want to view the transaction history. Let's assume the channel name is `mychannel`.

2. Use the following command to fetch the latest block data from the channel:

   ```bash
   peer channel fetch newest -c mychannel
   ```

   This command fetches the latest block from the `mychannel` and saves it to a file named `newest_block.pb`.

3. Once you have the block file (`newest_block.pb`), you can use the `configtxlator` tool to decode the block and extract the transaction information.

   First, convert the binary block file to JSON format using the following command:

   ```bash
   configtxlator proto_decode --input newest_block.pb --type common.Block --output newest_block.json
   ```

   This command decodes the binary block file (`newest_block.pb`) to JSON format and saves it as `newest_block.json`.

4. Open the `newest_block.json` file using a text editor or a JSON viewer to analyze the block data. Each block contains a list of transactions.

   You can explore the transactions within the block, including their IDs, timestamps, and other details. Analyzing the `actions` field in each transaction will provide information about the chaincode function invoked, arguments passed, and other relevant data.

   Note: The `newest_block.json` file will contain only the latest block's data. To view the complete transaction history, you would need to repeat the above steps for each block in the blockchain.

   Additionally, you can automate this process by writing a script that iterates over all the blocks in the blockchain and extracts the transaction information.

Remember to have the necessary permissions and access to the blockchain network to execute the `peer channel fetch` command and access the block data.
